Running Qwin on real hardware.

Status: booting,but panics(unexpected trap 13 from cpu 0).

This bug is related to xv6 compatibility issues with third party 
bootloaders.

Tested on:
PC(Intel Core i5,64-bit,GRUB 2),Laptop(Intel Atom XXXX,32-bit,GRUB 2 and 
Syslinux).


Both have the same problems - panic due to traps.
